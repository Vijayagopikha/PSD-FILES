<h2>WHAT IS AI?</h2>
<p>     Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p><br>

<h2>Histroy</h2>
<p> with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,[14] and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel ÄŒapek's R.U.R.[15] These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.[16]

The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the Churchâ€“Turing thesis.[17] This, along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.[18] The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons".[19]

By the 1950s, two visions for how to achieve machine intelligence emerged. One vision, known as Symbolic AI or GOFAI, was to use computers to create a symbolic representation of the world and systems that could reason about the world. Proponents included Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Marvin Minsky. Closely associated with this approach was the "heuristic search" approach, which likened intelligence to a problem of exploring a space of possibilities for answers. The second vision, known as the connectionist approach, sought to achieve intelligence through learning. Proponents of this approach, most prominently Frank Rosenblatt, sought to connect Perceptron in ways inspired by connections of neurons</p>

<h2>Knowledge representation</h2>
<p>Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering[48] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts.</p>
<p>AI research has developed tools to represent specific domains, such as objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;[50] situations, events, states and time;[51] causes and effects;[52] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);.[53] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); [54] as well as other domains. Among the most difficult problems in AI are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[55] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally</p>
<h2>Natural language processing</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Natural language processing (NLP)[68] allows machines to read and understand human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of NLP include information retrieval, question answering and machine translation</p></li>
<li><p>Symbolic AI used formal syntax to translate the deep structure of sentences into logic. This failed to produce useful applications, due to the intractability of logic[46] and the breadth of commonsense knowledge.[55] Modern statistical techniques include co-occurrence frequencies (how often one word appears near another), "Keyword spotting" (searching for a particular word to retrieve information), transformer-based deep learning (which finds patterns in text), and others.[70] They have achieved acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, and, by 2019, could generate coherent text.</p></li>

<h2>Types Of AI</h2>
<ul>
<li class="vijay"><h4>Reactive Machines</h4></li>
<p>  Technology capable of responding to external stimuli in real time, but unable to build a memory base and store information for future use.</p>
<li class="vijay"><h4>Limited Memory</h4></li>
<p>  Machines that can store knowledge and use it to learn and train for future tasks.</p> 
<li class="vijay"><h4>Theory of Mind</h4></li>
<p>  The concept of AI that can sense and respond to human emotions as well as perform the tasks of limited memory machines.</p>
<li class="vijay"><h4>Self-aware</h4></li>
<p>  The final stage of AI where machines can not only recognize the emotions of others, but also have a sense of self and a human-level intelligence.</p>
</ul>
<p><h2>A Brief Histroy Of Artificial Intelligence</h2></p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a brief timeline of the past six decades of how AI evolved from its inception.</p>

<pre>1956 - John McCarthy coined the term â€˜artificial intelligenceâ€™ and had the first AI conference.

1969 - Shakey was the first general-purpose mobile robot built. It is now able to do things with a purpose vs. just a 
       list of instructions.

1997 - Supercomputer â€˜Deep Blueâ€™ was designed, and it defeated the world champion chess player in a match. It was a 
       massive milestone by IBM to create this large computer.

2002 - The first commercially successful robotic vacuum cleaner was created. 

2005 - 2019 - Today, we have speech recognition, robotic process automation (RPA), a dancing robot, smart homes, and 
       other innovations make their debut.

2020 - Baidu releases the LinearFold AI algorithm to medical and scientific and medical teams developing a vaccine 
       during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. 
       The algorithm can predict the RNA sequence of the virus in only 27 seconds, which is 120 times faster than 
       other methods.
