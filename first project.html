<h2>WHAT IS AI?</h2>
<p>     Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p><br>

<h2>TYPES OF AI</h2>
<ul>
<li><h4>Reactive Machines</h4></li>
<p>  Technology capable of responding to external stimuli in real time, but unable to build a memory base and store information for future use.</p>
<li><h4>Limited Memory</h4></li>
<p>  Machines that can store knowledge and use it to learn and train for future tasks.</p> 
<li><h4>Theory of Mind</h4></li>
<p>  The concept of AI that can sense and respond to human emotions as well as perform the tasks of limited memory machines.</p>
<li><h4>Self-aware</h4></li>
<p>  The final stage of AI where machines can not only recognize the emotions of others, but also have a sense of self and a human-level intelligence.</p>

<p><h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2></p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a brief timeline of the past six decades of how AI evolved from its inception.</p>

<pre>1956 - John McCarthy coined the term â€˜artificial intelligenceâ€™ and had the first AI conference.

1969 - Shakey was the first general-purpose mobile robot built. It is now able to do things with a purpose vs. just a list of instructions.

1997 - Supercomputer â€˜Deep Blueâ€™ was designed, and it defeated the world champion chess player in a match. It was a massive milestone by IBM to create this large computer.

2002 - The first commercially successful robotic vacuum cleaner was created. 

2005 - 2019 - Today, we have speech recognition, robotic process automation (RPA), a dancing robot, smart homes, and other innovations make their debut.

2020 - Baidu releases the LinearFold AI algorithm to medical and scientific and medical teams developing a vaccine during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. 
       The algorithm can predict the RNA sequence of the virus in only 27 seconds, which is 120 times faster than other methods.
