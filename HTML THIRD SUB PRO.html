<h3><p>Deep learning,which is a subcategory of machine learning, provides AI with the ability to mimic a human brain’s neural network. It can make sense of patterns, noise, and sources of confusion in the data.

<p>The above image depicts the three main layers of a neural network:</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>INPUT LAYER</li></h4>
<li><h4>HIDDEN LAYER</li></h4>
<li><h4>OUTPUT LAYER</li></h4>
</ul>
<h2 style="color:red">INPUT LAYER</h2>
<p>The images that we want to segregate go into the input layer. Arrows are drawn from the image on to the individual dots of the input layer. Each of the white dots in the yellow layer (input layer) are a pixel in the picture. These images fill the white dots in the input layer.</p>
<p>We should have a clear idea of these three layers while going through this artificial intelligence tutorial.</p>
<h2 style="color:red">HIDDEN LAYER</h2>
<p>The hidden layers are responsible for all the mathematical computations or feature extraction on our inputs. In the above image, the layers shown in orange represent the hidden layers. The lines that are seen between these layers are called ‘weights’. Each one of them usually represents a float number, or a decimal number, which is multiplied by the value in the input layer. All the weights add up in the hidden layer. The dots in the hidden layer represent a value based on the sum of the weights. These values are then passed to the next hidden layer.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why there are multiple layers. The hidden layers function as alternatives to some degree. The more the hidden layers are, the more complex the data that goes in and what can be produced. The accuracy of the predicted output generally depends on the number of hidden layers present and the complexity of the data going in.
</p>
<h2 style="color:red">OUTPUT LAYER</h2>
<p>The output layer gives us segregated photos. Once the layer adds up all these weights being fed in, it'll determine if the picture is a portrait or a landscape.</p>
<pre>This prediction is based on various factors, including:

<li><h3>Destination airport</li></h3>
