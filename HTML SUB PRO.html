<h1><center>HOW AI REALLY WORKS</center></h1>
<body>
<p><h3> AI systems work by combining large sets of data with intelligent, iterative processing algorithms to learn from patterns and features in the data that they analyze.

Each time an AI system runs a round of data processing, it tests and measures its own performance and develops additional expertise.

Because AI never needs a break, it can run through hundreds, thousands, or even millions of tasks extremely quickly, learning a great deal in very little time, and becoming extremely capable at whatever it’s being trained to accomplish.

But the trick to understanding how AI truly works is understanding the idea that AI isn’t just a single computer program or application, but an entire discipline, or a science.The goal of AI science is to build a computer system that is capable of modeling human behavior so that it can use human-like thinking processes to solve complex problems.

To accomplish this objective, AI systems utilize a whole series of techniques and processes, as well as a vast array of different technologies.

By looking at these techniques and technologies, we can begin to really understand what AI actually does, and thus, how it works, so let’s take a look at those next.</h3></pre>
<h1>HOW IS AI BEING APPLIED?</h1>
<p><h3>     To fully get how AI works, it’s also important to understand where and how it’s actually being applied.

     Fortunately, there are many examples of AI’s use in the modern economy, including:

<li id="www">Retail</h2></li>
<p><h3>AI systems are being consulted to design more effective store layouts, handle stock management, and provide shopping suggestions, like via Amazon’s “You May Also Like” recommendations. 
</h3></p>
<li id="www">Healthcare</h2></li>
<p><h3>AI technology has been trained to provide personalized medicine, including giving reminders about when patients need to take their medicine and suggestions for specific exercises they should perform to improve their recovery from injuries.
</h3></p>
<li id="www" >Manufacturing</h2></li>
<p><h3>AI solutions help forecast load and demand for factories, improving their efficiency, and allow factory managers to make better decisions about ordering materials, completion timetables, and other logistics issues.
</h3></p>
<li id="www">Life Sciences</h2></li>
<p><h3>AI intelligence is actively applied to review complex data sets that are useful in testing new medicines, helping life science organizations get effective medicines to market faster.
</h3></p>
<li id="www">Finance</h2></li>
<p><h3>AI tools are being leveraged to detect and prevent fraudulent financial transactions, provide more accurate assessments than traditional credit scores can, and automate all sorts of data-related tasks that were handled manually.
